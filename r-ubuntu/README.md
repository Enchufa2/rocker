r-ubuntu -- 'r-base' for Ubuntu LTS
===================================

This Dockerfile is close to the 'r-base' container for Rocker -- which is the
same container as the official 'r-base' container for R -- but based on
Ubuntu LTS.  While 'r-base' uses Debian testing, this container is based on
the LTS release and connects to the PPA by Michael Rutter with over 4,000
r-cran-* packages.

As always, work in progress -- please come and talk to @eddelbuettel and
@cboettig (via GitHub issue tickets) about how to get involved.

Documentation is being added at the [Wiki](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki).
